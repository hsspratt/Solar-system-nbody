# Welcome to Solar-system-nbody

Solar-system-nbody is a n body simulation written in python. There is a GUI which enables the user to add a limited number of configurations, howvever the core code can work for as many objects as needed, they just have to be initialised first. The code as it is computes the position data for the planets initialised and then procedes to analyse the data by plotting a number of graphs including the 2D orbit, KE, PE and Momentum of the system. The code uses scipy.integrate.solve_ivp which is a nifty integrator which automatically detects the time steps at which to compute the integration. However all important aspects of the integrator can be changed in the GUI such as the time step (max_steps) and the tolerances (r_tol & a_tol). The objective of Solar_system_nbody is to produce an accurate simulation of the solar system, ideally at quick speeds. In addition to the simulation there is also a plotting of the effective potential and the lagrange points which can be run.

## How it works

Firstly, check that you have these Python libraries: TKinter, NumPy, Matplotlib. If you have not installed python, I recommend using the Anaconda installer with Visual Studio Code as an IDE. Although spyder is typically the main IDE, i find that compatability with spyder and tkinter on MacOSX unreliable at times. 

After downloading the code folder the program can be started by running **Simulation (GUI).py** in the main directory. This will launch the GUI from which you will be able to change a number of variables. The GUI will look like the image given below.

1. Choose what configurations to simulate. The planets (and stars) in the solar system such as the Sun, Earth, Venus initialise only one planet. However all the other configurations will iniialise multiple planets. These configuratioins can not be merged as the physics will not work. All the configurations bar the Solar System are simulations, such they are not here physical they don't not have the necessity to have physical values instead they have been non-dimentinalised. The configurations and examples of how they can be configured for the simulation to work are shown below.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
